Technical resume very different than regular resume

Craft resume for HR, Hiring Manager, Engineer

Ensure resume is hitting keywords. Easily searchable.
Use Skills/Languages to use keywords

Less is more with resumes. One page. Cut out details that dont necessarily make you look good.

Leave out positions/roles that arent as important

3. Less formatting the better. Dont use colors/formats. Be scanner friendly. Stick with bold. Always export to PDF
4. Avoid exaggerating. Especially during interview.

first 2-3 items on resume are those that you should be able to explain.
Explain what YOU did. Not what team did.
