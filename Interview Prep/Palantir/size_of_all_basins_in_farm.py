''' A group of farmers has some elevation data, and we are going to help them understand how rainfall flows over their farmland.
We will represent the land as a two-dimensional array of altitudes and use the following model, based on the idea that water flows downhill.
If a cell's four neighboring cells all have higher altitudes, we call this cell a sink; water collects in sinks.
Otherwise, water will flow to the neighboring cell with the lowest altitude. 
If a cell is not a sink, you may assume it has a unique lowest neighbor and that this neighbor will be lower than the cell.
Cells that drain into the same sink - directly or indirectly - are said to be part of the same basin.
Your challenge is to partition the map into basins. In particular, given a map of elevations, your code should partition the map into basins and output the sizes of the basins, in descending order.'''
